LIST CONTD.
CLASSES AND OBJECTS -
Class is a blueprint.
An object is an instance of that blueprint.

ex - HUMAN is a class. Chetan is an Object(instance) of the class.

Every class have attributes(properties of class) and behaviour(operations on the attributes)
ex- bike is a class. CB shine is an object of class bike. Attributes(properties) are average, speed, tank capacity.

behaviour is some sort of operations on attributes.

In some programming languages attributes are also known as data members and behaviour is also known as member functions(methods)

OPERATOR OVERLOADING -
Changing the behaviour of the object is known as operator overloading.
for ex-
a=10
b=20
a+b
30

l1+l2 #appends l1 and l2 and returns result
l1.__add__(l2) #appends l1 and l2 and returns result
l1.__iadd__(l2) #appends l1 and l2 and stores result in l1
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

and

l1=[1,2,3]
l2=[4,5,6]
l1+l2 #appends the l2 to l1 and prints it
[1,2,3,4,5,6]


TUPLE : It is a list which is immutable
It is constant list. A list which once created cannot be changed.

syntax :
t = () #tuple is created by using round brackets
t = tuple() #constructor

example:
t = (1)
type(t)
<class 'int'> #treated (1) as int because '()' are also used in expressions such as (1+2)*(3+1)

to overcome this
t= (1,) #add a comma to treat it as a TUPLE
type(t)
<class 'tuple'>

Assignment :
Read list methods through help(list)
Read tuple methods through help(tuple)
Make an excel sheet with columns 'operations' 'list' 'tuple'
