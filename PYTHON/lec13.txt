Operating System will by default open 3 files whenever you run a program
these are
0 stdin #input File
1 stdout #output FILE
2 stderr #error File

in a python program if you write fd.fileno() it will return number of files opened by the program, by default every file will open above 3 files

>>> fd = open("test.txt", 'w')
>>> fd.fileno()
3

>>> print("HELLO") #By Default file parameter is set to sys.stdin which means print function will print data to the console
HELLO
>>> fd = open("print.txt","w")
>>> print("HELLO", file=fd) #after passing fd (file descriptor) to the print it will directly write to file
>>> fd.readline()
>>> fd = open("print.txt")
>>> fd.readline()
'HELLO\n'

WAP to accept file name and print alternate lines in a file
WAP to implement cp command (copy contents from one file to another)
