Bitwise operators
& Bitwise AND (ex 13 & 5 gives 13)
| Bitwise OR
^ Bitwise XOR
<< Left shift
>> Right shift

examples 
9 and 19 = 19
9 or 19 = 9
9 & 19 = 1
9 & 19 = 1
9 | 19 = 27
9 ^ 19 = 26
5<<2 = 20
5>>2 = 1

write a program to accept a number and check whether it is power of two
#!
a=int(input("Enter number "))
if a&(a-1)==0:
    print("Number is a power of 2")
else:
    print("Number is not a power of 2")

Control flow
1 Sequence
2 if...else
3 loops

for loop example to print each letter in a string on new line
#!
name = (raw_input("Enter your Name : "))
for val in name:
    print(val)

WAP to accept a string and print all its character except P
#!
name = (raw_input("Enter your Name : "))
for val in name:
    if val=='p':
        pass
    else:
        print(val)

WAP to skip the user entered character in a string
#!
name = (raw_input("Enter a string : "))
pat = (raw_input("Enter a pattern which you want to exclude : "))
for val in name:
    if val==pat:
        pass
    else:
        print(val)

Range function - if given a number then it generates a range from 0 to that number
also accepts start index and end index, also stepvalue is used to skip that many numbers after a specific number
if you pass single value to range function then it will consider it as end index and start generating numbers from 0

example - 
for num in range(10):
    print(num)
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

using startindex and endindex and stepvalue
for num in range(1,11,2):
    print(num)
1
3
5
7
9

WAP to accept a number from user and print its table
#!
num = int(input("Enter a number : "))
for val in range(1,11):
    print(num*val)

WAP to print all numbers which are divisible by 3 and 5 within range 1 to 100
#!
#num = int(input("Enter a number : "))
for val in range(1,100):
    if num%3==0 and num%5==0:
        print(val," is divisible by 3 & 5")
    else:
        pass

WAP a program to accept a year from user and check whether it is a leap year
#!
#num = int(input("Enter a number : "))
for val in range(1,100):
    if val%3==0 and val%5==0:
        print(val," is divisible by 3 & 5")
    else:
        pass

WAP where the numbers between 1 to 20 print a cube for all the odd numbers in that range and print the square for even number and if the number is divisible by 5 dont do anything
#!
for val in range(1,21,1):
    if val%5==0:
        continue
    if val%2==0:
        print(val**2)
    elif val%2==1:
        print(val**3)
